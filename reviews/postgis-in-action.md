**TL;DR A deep dive into geospatial PostgreSQL.**

This book is a great book for anyone looking into working with geospatial data. Plus, if you like PostgreSQL and relational databases as much as I do, prepare to be amazed by usage of PostgreSQL's most advanced features in some real world examples. This book has them all: window functions, recursive queries, triggers, expression indexes and more. 

Having never worked with serious geospatial data except som basic lat-long modelling, this is was a very refreshing read and you will find everything you need here for a quick start into the wonderful world of maps, vectors, topologies. I especially liked that authors give you overview of the "full stack" with recommendations. You will find listings of possible tools you can use, with the pros/cons listed. This literally saved me hours if I had to find, install and try out them all.

**TL;DR Everything a developer needs to know about geospatial data with PostgreSQL and more.**

This book is an awesome treasure trove of information not just on working with geospatial data, but also on SQL. Even seasoned SQL enthusiasts will find interesting approaches to problems. The book also covers loading data into the database, cleaning it up and presenting it. All that in addition to providing a LOT of examples on how to query the data to have something to present. You will learn a lot about geospatial data - spatial reference systems, geometry, geography, rasters and topologies just to name a few. The breadth of topics covered will allow the reader to work with most geospatial data out there.

If there is anything to criticize its the tedium of the writing at times and the exhausting level of detail the examples go to. Be prepared to brush up on your SQL, because this book really leans on even the most esoteric aspects of the language. Fortunately, there is a nice refresher in one of the appendices.
